// Holder balances derived from Transfer logs, instead of asked of an explorer.
//
// Blockscout pages 50 holders at a time, so a token with 1,815 holders is ~37
// sequential requests through a shared public service that has answered a single
// page in 18 seconds, returned 504 four times running, and hung long enough to
// wedge a whole cycle. It sits directly in the payout path, and nothing checks
// its answer: a short list is paid as a short list.
//
// The chain has the same information and your own RPC serves it. Measured on
// this chain: 50,000 blocks of Transfer logs in 872ms, and the sibling NEKO launch's entire history
// is ~12 such calls — about 11 seconds, once. After that each cycle indexes only
// the blocks since the last one, which is a single fast call.
//
// The part that matters more than the speed: a derived index can be CHECKED.
// Balances must sum to totalSupply(), and if they do not the index is wrong and
// says so, before any NVDA moves. There is no equivalent check on an explorer's
// answer — you either trust it or you do not.
//
// This is deliberately a fold over an append-only log, so it is not idempotent:
// applying a batch twice doubles it. Correctness rests entirely on lastBlock
// advancing past exactly what was applied, which is why the persisted record
// carries both and is written together.
